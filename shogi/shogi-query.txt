!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Goggles are simple, self-contained text files which can be hosted in Github or
! Gitlab. These files contain instructions allowing you to tell Brave Search how
! you'd like your results to be ranked. You can target specific URL patterns
! (and, soon, website titles and other aspects of Web pages) and indicate how
! their ranking should be altered (e.g. boosted, downranked, or completely
! discarded from the results).

! A Goggle source file consists of instructions, one per line. Empty lines, or
! comments (starting with an exclamation mark: '!') are ignored. If your Goggle
! contains invalid instructions, submitting the Goggle on Brave Search will fail
! and you will get feedback regarding what went wrong.

! You probably already noticed the header of this file which contains some
! metadata about your Goggle, such as: name, description, public and author.
! These are *mandatory*.

! Additionally, you can specify the following optional metadata attributes:
! * homepage — specifies a homepage URL displayed on your Goggle's profile.
! * issues — specifies a URL where users can report issues for your Goggle.
! * transferred_to — Allows to transfer ownership of a Goggle.
! * avatar —  specifies a *valid* HEX color code for your Goggle.
! * license — specifies the license of a Goggle's instructions.

! The simplest instruction is a plain-text pattern which can be found in URLs.
! The following would match any search result whose URL contains the pattern
! as-is:
! /this/is/a/pattern

! It is also possible to use some limited "globbing" capabilities such as the
! '*' character which will match zero, one or more characters (note: the number
! of wildcards allowed in a given instruction is limited):
! /this/is/*/pattern

! The special character '^' can be used to indicate that an URL delimiter such
! as '/' or end-of-url can be matched. More specifically, '^' is equivalent to
! the regexp: [^\w\d._%-]|$
!
! This means that it can match either the end of the URL or any character that is
! not a letter, digit, dot, underscore, percent sign or dash. Here are a few
! examples of characters that are matched by '^': / (slash), = (equal),
! [ (bracket), : (colon), etc.
!
! In practice, you will usually want to use '/' (or any other specific
! separator like '=' or '?') most of the time in your patterns, except at the end
! of a pattern in cases where you want to be a little bit more generic, and
! express that your pattern should be either matching at the end of the URL or be
! followed by a separator and then arbitrary URL components.
!
! For example, |https://example.org^ will match: 'https://example.org',
! 'https://example.org/' or 'https://example.org/path'; but it will *not* match
! 'https://example.org.ac', which is also a valid domain name starting with
! 'https://example.org'.
!
! Another example, /foo.js^ will match: 'https://example.org/foo.js',
! 'https://example.org/foo.js?param=42', 'https://example.org/foo.js/' but it
! will *not* match 'https://example.org/foo.jsx' (because it is not followed by a
! separator).
!
! Also note that the maximum number of carets allowed in a given instruction is
! limited.
! /this/is/a/pattern^
! |https://example.org^
! /foo.js^

! By default, a pattern can match anywhere in the URL, but there are specific
! characters which can be used to indicate prefix or suffix matches: we call them
! "anchors".
!
! The '|' character can be used at the beginning or end of an instruction to
! indicate anchoring. The following instruction will match a prefix of the URL:
|https://en.

! The following will match a suffix of the URL:
! /some/path.html|

! Both can be used at the same time:
! |https://brave.com|

! Additionally, each instruction can specify a list of options, following the
! '$' character and separated by commas (','). Options can be used to more finely
! target specific search results, or to indicate how a matched result's ranking
! should be altered.

! The most basic option is 'site=', which can be used to limit a instruction to
! a specific website, based on its domain. Options can be specified on their own
! (e.g. if you want to target any page of a site) or in conjunction with a
! pattern:
! $site=brave.com
! /blog/$site=brave.com

! Another set of options can be used to indicate what you want your instruction
! to target. By default any instruction will apply to a URL, but we will add the
! ability to match other aspects of a page too, in the future:
!
! web3$inurl
! web3$intitle
! web3$indescription
! web3$incontent

! Finally, you can specify an 'action', which indicates how the ranking of a
! matched result should be changed by your instruction. This is the mechanism
! through which you can customize the ranking of results to your liking. You can
! use one of three possible actions in your instructions, and by default, any
! instruction without an action will be considered as 'boost':
! /r/brave_browser/
! /r/brave_browser/$boost
! /r/brave_browser/$boost=2
! /r/brave_browser/$boost=3

! The value associated with the option indicate the 'strength' with which you
! want to alter the ranking (note: that it is currently limited to a maximum
! value of 10). It can be used to boost results differently, even inside of the
! same Goggle (e.g. some results should be favored more than others).
!
! You can also downrank results:
! /r/google/$downrank
! /r/google/$downrank=2
! /r/google/$downrank=3

! Last but not least, you can discard results completely:
! $discard,site=idontwanttobepartoftheresults.com
! /this/is/spam/$discard

! Individually, each instruction can either target a very narrow set of pages (or
! even a single page), or a wider range of them, to apply reranking to a bigger
! set of results. In combination, hundreds or more instructions can allow you to
! express complex reranking functions.

! Although the Goggles language could express instructions to search through a
! small set of websites or act as a blocklist, Goggles really shine when used to
! express boosting and downranking across many domains and pages.

! Goggles also impacts the behavior of features such as Discussions and News or
! Videos clusters, giving you full control on your search experience.
!
! We are already using Goggles internally, and we can't wait to see what you will
! do with them!

! To learn more about Goggles, we recomend that you read the "Learn by example"
! section of our "Getting Started" page here: https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/blob/main/getting-started.md#learn-by-example
